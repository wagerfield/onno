# Preface <!-- omit in toc -->

Onno is an iteration of [Styled System][styled-system] rewritten in [TypeScript][typescript] from the ground up. A lot of the ideas are owed to the brilliant work of [Brent Jackson][jxnblk] and the [numerous contributors][styled-system-contributors] to this library. Credit is also due to [Emotion's facepaint][emotion-facepaint] for the original ideas behind responsive prop values.

Onno actually started life as a rewrite of Styled System in [TypeScript][typescript] following a [discussion on GitHub][styled-system-comment]. However, during the course of this rewrite, a number of new ideas, features and refinements to Styled System's API were introduced that eventually warranted another library.

## Features <!-- omit in toc -->

Below is a list of additional features and refinements to Styled System's API that have been introduced by onno.

- [Framework agnostic](#framework-agnostic)
- [TypeScript](#typescript)
- [Prop keys as an array](#prop-keys-as-an-array)
- [Style keys as an array](#style-keys-as-an-array)
- [Theme keys as an array](#theme-keys-as-an-array)
- [Serializable themes](#serializable-themes)
- [Dot syntax for props and theme keys](#dot-syntax-for-props-and-theme-keys)
- [Simpler transform functions](#simpler-transform-functions)
- [More render functions and aliases](#more-render-functions-and-aliases)
- [Strict naming conventions](#strict-naming-conventions)

### Framework agnostic

Styled System is designed to work with [React][react]. It has a dependency on [`prop-types`][prop-types] (a library for defining runtime type checks on React props) and provides `propTypes` for each of its render functions. It works in harmony with [Styled Components][styled-components] (a React-only CSS in JS library) as well as [Emotion's `styled` API][emotion-styled-components] which maintains close parity with Styled Components.

The key difference between Emotion and Styled Components is that [Emotion is framework agnostic][emotion-framework-agnostic] at its core. And it's not alone. Many other popular [CSS in JS][css-in-js] libraries like [JSS][jss], [Aphrodite][aphrodite] and [Fela][fela] can also be used with other popular frameworks like [Vue][vue] and [Angular][angular].

As a developer who works with React and Vue in equal measure, using libraries that are framework agnostic is _desireable_â€”if not a _requirement_ in some cases. While developing onno, it was _essential_ that it could be used with any framework to facilitate code reuse between component libraries implemented in React, Vue, Angular et al.

Onno was therefore designed with an interface for providing framework specific integrations. Currently there are extensions of `onno` for React (`onno-react`) and Vue (`onno-vue`) that provide `propTypes` and `props` for these respective frameworks. In the future, additional extensions can be added for other frameworks if the demand is there.

If you want to use `propTypes` for runtime prop validation with React, install `onno-react` in place of `onno` and import the render functions as you normally would. `onno-react` provides a `propTypes` function that expects an array of `render` functions and returns a `propTypes` object.

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components"
import { display, flexSet, propTypes } from "onno-react"

const styles = [display, flexSet]

const Box = styled.div(...styles)

Box.propTypes = propTypes(styles)
```

It is worth noting that _composed_ render functions like `flexSet` include all `propTypes` for the functions they map to.

### TypeScript

Onno is written in TypeScript and ships with a comprehensive set of type definitions and interfaces. Additionally, it uses `csstype` for all included render functions to type check the values passed to `props`. Type checking is performed on both _standard_ and _responsive_ prop values as well as `defaultProps` when used with React. For example:

```tsx
import styled from "styled-components"
import {
  display,
  DisplayProps,
  flexDirection,
  FlexDirectionProps
} from "onno"

type BoxProps = DisplayProps & FlexDirectionProps

const Box = styled.div<BoxProps>(display, flexDirection)

Box.defaultProps = {
  display: "flex",
  flexDirection: "foo" // Type "foo" is not assignable to type "Prop<FlexDirectionProperty>"
}

// Type "bar" is not assignable to type "Prop<FlexDirectionProperty>"
<Box flexDirection="bar" />
```

In addition to this, onno provides a `Theme` interface that includes all the `themeKeys` that are declared across the suite of [render functions](render-functions.md) included with onno. This makes writing themes a breeze since you get both autocompletion and type checking out of the box.

```ts
import { Theme } from "onno"

export const theme: Theme = {
  breakpoints: [
    { alias: "xs", value: 0 },
    { alias: "sm", value: 256 },
    { alias: "md", value: 512 },
    { alias: "lg", value: 768 },
    { alias: "xl", value: 1024 }
  ],
  maxWidths: [256, 512, 768, 1024],
  foo: "bar" // Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'ThemeValue'
}
```

To add your own `themeKeys` simply create an interface that extends from `Theme`

### Prop keys as an array

Styled System's [`style`][styled-system-api-style] function allows you to specify both a `prop` key and optional `alias` for the render function to map values from. Onno takes this one step further by consolidating these two options into a `propsKeys` array which allows you to specify as many aliases as you like, while also enforcing an order of precedence for them. For example:

```jsx
import styled from "styled-system"
import { style } from "onno"

const fontFamily = style({
  propsKeys: ["fontFamily", "font", "ff", "f"]
})

const Text = styled.div(fontFamily)

// [{ fontFamily: "Roboto" }]
<Text fontFamily="Roboto" />

// [{ fontFamily: "Helvetica" }]
<Text font="Helvetica" />

// [{ fontFamily: "Lobster" }]
<Text ff="Lobster" />

// [{ fontFamily: "Monaco" }]
<Text f="Monaco" />

// [{ fontFamily: "Roboto" }]
// The "fontFamily" prop has the highest order of precedence
<Text f="Monaco" fontFamily="Roboto" ff="Lobster" font="Helvetica" />
```

### Style keys as an array

Styled System provides a `cssProperty` option to map a `prop` key to a different CSS property. If the `cssProperty` option is omitted, the `prop` key is used by default. This works well for one-to-one key maps, but does not support one-to-many key maps.

In some cases you need to map a `prop` value to multiple `style` keys. Examples of this are the `size` prop that maps to `width` and `height` style keys and the `marginX` prop that maps to `marginLeft` and `marginRight` style keys. Onno's `styleKeys` option supports this functionality:

```jsx
import styled from "styled-system"
import { style } from "onno"

const font = style({
  propsKeys: ["font", "f"],
  styleKeys: ["fontFamily"]
})

const size = style({
  propsKeys: ["size", "s"],
  styleKeys: ["width", "height"]
})

const Box = styled.div(font, size)

// [{ fontFamily: "Monaco" }, { width: "100px", height: "100px" }]
<Box font="Monaco" size="100px" />

// [{ fontFamily: "Roboto" }, { width: "50%", height: "50%" }]
<Box f="Roboto" s="50%" />
```

If you omit the `styleKeys` option then it defaults to an array containing the first key in the `propsKeys` array. This is the desired behaviour for the majority of one-to-one key maps like `display`, `fontSize`, `boxShadow` etc.

### Theme keys as an array

Styled System provides a `key` option for specifying a "lookup" location in a `theme`. This mechanism allows you to share design tokens between your render functions and the components using them.

Onno takes this one step further by upgrading a single theme `key` to an array of `themeKeys`. In doing so, you can create render functions that resolve values from multiple locations in a `theme` by cascading through them in order of precedence. For example:

```jsx
import styled from "styled-system"
import { style } from "onno"

const size = style({
  propsKeys: ["size", "s"],
  styleKeys: ["width", "height"],
  themeKeys: ["sizes"]
})

const width = style({
  propsKeys: ["width", "w"],
  themeKeys: ["widths", "sizes"]
})

const theme = {
  sizes: ["100px", "200px", "400px"],
  widths: ["80px", "160px"]
}

const Box = styled.div(size, width)

// [{ width: "100px", height: "100px" }, { width: "160px" }]
<Box theme={theme} size={0} width={1} />

// [{ width: "200px", height: "200px" }, { width: "400px" }]
<Box theme={theme} s={1} w={2} />
```

The second `Box` provides a `width` prop value of `2` which falls outside the `widths` array in the `theme`. Since the `width` render function specifies two `themeKeys` of "widths" and "sizes" the resolver then moves onto the `sizes` key in the `theme` where it is able to resolve a value of "400px" at that location.

If the `theme` did not have a `widths` array then the `sizes` array would resolve values for both render functions.

### Serializable themes

It is good practice to define a `theme` _or facets of a theme_ in a serializable data structure such as JSON or YAML. Doing so facilitates the portability of design tokens between languages and platforms. This is how companies like [GitHub][github-primer-primitives] organise their design tokens and projects like [Theo][salesforce-theo] consume and distribute them.

When working with arrays of values in a `theme` (Styled System refers to these as "scales") the only way to retrieve values from them is via an index. For large arrays of values, this can make it difficult to keep track of which index you require for a particular value and often leads to counting through the array with your finger. Further problems arise when values are added or removed from the array causing indexes to resolve to different values.

Styled System's solution to the first problem is to create index aliases by adding string keys to an array of values _after_ it has been created and assigning them to values within the array. Though this approach works in JavaScript, it does not lend itself well to serialization and TypeScript does not allow string index signatures on arrays.

To address this problem, onno introduced "alias objects" which support array value lookups using both an `index` and a string `alias`. An alias object takes this form of `{ alias: string, value: any }`. This solution lends itself to serialization while also tackling the issue of adding, removing and reordering items in an array (as long as you are referencing the values via the `alias` of course).

For example, a `theme` written in JSON using array alias objects would look like this:

```json
{
  "sizes": [
    {
      "alias": "sm",
      "value": 16
    },
    {
      "alias": "md",
      "value": 32
    },
    {
      "alias": "lg",
      "value": 64
    }
  ]
}
```

Using onno's internal `get` utility, you can retrieve the second value in the `sizes` array by doing:

```js
import { get } from "onno"
import theme from "./theme.json"

const a = get("sizes.1", theme) // 32
const b = get("sizes.md", theme) // 32
```

Internally onno uses the `get` method to resolve all `theme` and `defaults` values allowing you to use alias objects throughout your design system. Internally onno uses alias objects for the default `breakpoints` array:

```json
{
  "breakpoints": [
    { "alias": "xs", "value": 0 },
    { "alias": "sm", "value": 360 },
    { "alias": "md", "value": 720 },
    { "alias": "lg", "value": 1080 },
    { "alias": "xl", "value": 1440 }
  ]
}
```

Declaring `breakpoints` as alias objects allows responsive props to use both array and object value maps:

```jsx
import styled from "styled-system"
import { style } from "onno"

const width = style({
  propsKeys: ["width", "w"]
})

const Box = styled.div(width)

// [
//   { "@media(min-width: 0)":     { width: "100%" } },
//   { "@media(min-width: 720px)": { width: "50%"  } }
// ]
<Box width={[ "100%", null, "50%" ]} />

// [
//   { "@media(min-width: 0)":     { width: "100%" } },
//   { "@media(min-width: 720px)": { width: "50%"  } }
// ]
<Box width={{ xs: "100%", md: "50%" }} />
```

### Dot syntax for props and theme keys

Styled System supports dot syntax for both `prop` values and theme `key` options. This allows you to lookup values in nested objects and arrays within a `theme` and the default `scale` of a render function.

Onno also supports dot syntax for `prop` values, `themeKeys` and _alias objects_ within arrays. This flexible interface allows you to structure and nest your `theme` however you like. In addition to this, onno supports inversion of _any_ value simply by prefixing a lookup path or index with a negative sign. For example:

```jsx
import styled from "styled-system"
import { addPx, style } from "onno"

const width = style({
  propsKeys: ["width", "w"],
  transform: addPx,
  defaults: {
    small: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32],
    large: [20, 40, 80, 160, 320]
  }
})

const margin = style({
  propsKeys: ["margin", "m"],
  transform: addPx,
  defaults: [16, 32, 64, 128, 256]
})

const Box = styled.div(width, margin)

// [{ width: "8px" }, { margin: "128px" }]
<Box width="small.2" margin={3} />

// [{ width: "-320px" }, { margin: "-32px" }]
<Box w="-large.4" m={-1} />
```

### Simpler transform functions

Styled System provides a `transformValue` option for transforming values _before_ they are mapped to CSS properties. This is useful for appending units like "px" to unitless values. Styled System's `transformValue` option expects a function with the signature `(value, scale) => value`. This API was designed to support cases where you might want to invert a value from a scaleâ€”such as when working with negative margins or positioning.

Since onno's internal `get` utility supports inversion for _all_ values, passing the `scale` (or "lookup" as referred to by onno) to a `transform` function is not necessary. Onno's `transform` option therefore expects a function with the signature `(value) => value`

### More render functions and aliases

Styled System ships with a comprehensive set of render functions. Onno builds on these to provide a more complete set that covers the majority of commonly used CSS properties. More can be added in time with demand, so please [submit a feature request][onno-issues] if you require a render function that is not implemented yet.

[Onno's render functions](render-functions.md) have been organised across a number of [source files][onno-src] to facilitate maintenance and include many useful composed render functions. In addition to this, each render function included with onno provides a prop `alias` to facilitate rapid UI development. These aliases should be used at your own discretion since their terse benefits come at a sacrifice of self-documentation and readability for anyone not familiar with them.

### Strict naming conventions

A number of naming conventions have been introduced by onno to help enforce consistency and predictability.

1. All _standard_ render functions have the same name as the CSS property they are rendering eg. `fontSize`, `boxShadow` and `textAlign`
   - The only exception to this rule are the special render functions that map a `prop` to multiple style keys eg. `marginX`, `marginY`, `paddingX`, `paddingY` and `size`
   - Styled System adopts this convention for all functions par `color` which is a composition of the `textColor` and `backgroundColor` functions.
   - To adhere to the convention, onno's `color` function simply renders the text `color` property. It is _not_ a composed function like it is in Styled System.
2. All _standard_ render functions provide `propsKeys` aliases with the following naming conventions:
   - `background` prop aliases _start_ with `bg`
   - `border` prop aliases _start_ with `bd`
   - `overflow` prop aliases _start_ with `of`
   - `flex` prop aliases _start_ with `fx`
   - `grid` prop aliases _start_ with `g`
   - `place` prop aliases _start_ with `pl`
   - `align` prop aliases _start_ with `al`
   - `justify` prop aliases _start_ with `jf`
   - `margin` prop aliases _start_ with `m`
   - `padding` prop aliases _start_ with `p`
   - `font` prop aliases _start_ with `f`
   - `text` prop aliases _start_ with `t`
   - `shadow` prop aliases _end_ with `sh`
   - `variant` prop aliases _end_ with `st`
3. All _composed_ render functions follow the convention of ending in "Set" eg. `colorSet` and `spaceSet`
   - This convention creates a distinction between _standard_ and _composed_ render functions and circumvents naming collisions such as `border` (the shorthand CSS property) and `borderSet` (a composition of all the border related render functions)
   - With reference to point 1, all _color_ related render functions (`color`, `backgroundColor` and `borderColor`) are composed into a `colorSet` render function.
   - Both `flex` and `grid` render functions are organised into a `ParentSet`, `ChildSet` and complete `Set` which contains all render functions. For example: `flexParentSet`, `flexChildSet` and `flexSet`
4. All `theme` keys follow a plural naming convention and use the same name as the _standard_ or _composed_ render functions. The key differences between Styled System and onno's theme keys are:
   - `fonts Â» fontFamilies`
   - `space Â» spaces`
   - `radii Â» borderRadii` (with `radii` fallback)
   - `shadows Â» boxShadows` (onno also has `textShadows`)
   - `buttons Â» buttonStyles`
5. All _variant_ render functions end in "Style" eg. `buttonStyle` and `colorStyle`.
   - Variant theme keys follow the convention of ending in "Styles" eg. `buttonStyles` and `colorStyles`
